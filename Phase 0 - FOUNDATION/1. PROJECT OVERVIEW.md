# PROJECT OVERVIEW - Kaven Boilerplate

> **Version:** 1.0.0  
> **Date:** December 16, 2025  
> **Author:** Chris (@bychrisr)  
> **Type:** Complete Vision Document  
> **Status:** Foundation Phase

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Kaven Boilerplate** is an enterprise-grade, cloneable SaaS foundation that eliminates 2-4 weeks of repetitive development work. Unlike basic auth templates, Kaven provides a **production-ready ecosystem** with multi-tenancy, RBAC, payments, CRM, and observability built-in.

**Core Philosophy:**

> "Clone once, extend infinitely. Every SaaS starts here, none end here."

Kaven is designed to be **forked and extended**, not used as-is. The schema, modules, and architecture are intentionally flexible to support any vertical (B2B, B2C, marketplace, internal tools).

---

## 🌟 VISION & MISSION

### Vision

Become the **de facto foundation** for Brazilian SaaS founders, enabling rapid validation without compromising on security, scalability, or maintainability.

### Mission

Provide a battle-tested boilerplate that:

1. **Saves time:** 2-4 weeks of boilerplate → 2 hours of setup
2. **Enforces best practices:** Security, testing, documentation built-in
3. **Scales infinitely:** From MVP to enterprise without refactoring
4. **Updates cleanly:** Versioned packages allow seamless updates

## 🎨 ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

### 1. Multi-Tenant "Camaleão" Architecture

**Core Concept: "Quem pode o mais, pode o menos"**

Kaven is **natively multi-tenant** but can operate as **single-tenant** via configuration flag.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  User (can exist with OR without tenant)   │
│  ↓                                          │
│  UserTenant (junction, many-to-many)       │
│  ↓                                          │
│  Tenant (organization/workspace)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Middleware Modes:**

**MULTI Mode (`APP_MODE=MULTI`):**

- Detects tenant via subdomain (apple.saas.com)
- Loads tenant from database
- Injects `tenantId` into request context
- All queries auto-filter by tenant

**SINGLE Mode (`APP_MODE=SINGLE`):**

- Ignores subdomain
- Uses fixed `DEFAULT_TENANT_ID=1`
- All queries use same tenant (transparent)
- UI hides tenant creation

**Key Features:**

- **Tenant-scoped users:** Regular SaaS users (99% of cases)
- **Tenant-less users:** Super Admins, onboarding users, platform managers
- **Multi-tenant users:** Can belong to multiple tenants, switch context
- **Row-Level Security:** Prisma middleware auto-injects `WHERE tenantId = ?`

**Upgrade Path:**

```bash
# Start as single-tenant
APP_MODE=SINGLE

# Years later, customer wants multi-tenant
APP_MODE=MULTI

# No code changes needed!
```

---

### 2. Extensible Schema Philosophy

Every Prisma model is designed to be **extended, not replaced**.

**The Cloneable Pattern:**

```prisma
// ✅ KAVEN BASE (boilerplate)
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String
  tenantId  String?  // Nullable = allows tenant-less users
  metadata  Json?    // Extensibility for custom fields
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  tenant    Tenant?  @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id])
}

// ✅ YOUR SAAS (after cloning)
model User {
  // Keep all base fields
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String
  tenantId  String?
  metadata  Json?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  // Add custom fields
  avatar    String?
  bio       String?
  timezone  String   @default("America/Sao_Paulo")
  preferences Json?
  
  // Add custom relations
  tenant    Tenant?  @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id])
  posts     Post[]   // Your custom model
}
```

**Extension Strategies:**

1. **Core Fields:** Never remove (id, email, tenantId, createdAt, updatedAt)
2. **Custom Fields:** Add specific to your SaaS (avatar, bio, settings)
3. **Metadata JSON:** For highly dynamic data (preferences, config)
4. **Custom Relations:** Link to your own models (User → CustomModel)

**Why This Matters:**

- ✅ Updates from Kaven won't break your schema
- ✅ You can pull security fixes to core fields
- ✅ Your customizations stay isolated
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation works regardless of extensions

---

### 3. Modular Architecture (Monorepo with Packages)

**Decision:** Use Turborepo monorepo with versioned NPM packages.

**Recommended Structure:**

```
kaven-boilerplate/
├── packages/                    # Versioned NPM packages
│   ├── @kaven/core             # Auth, Multi-tenant, RBAC
│   ├── @kaven/ui               # shadcn components + layouts
│   ├── @kaven/payments         # Stripe + Pix + subscriptions
│   ├── @kaven/crm              # CRM module
│   ├── @kaven/invoices         # Invoice management
│   ├── @kaven/files            # File manager
│   ├── @kaven/chat             # Real-time chat
│   ├── @kaven/mail             # Mail inbox
│   ├── @kaven/referral         # Referral system
│   └── @kaven/analytics        # Dashboard + reports
│
├── apps/                        # Example applications
│   ├── admin                   # Main admin panel (Next.js)
│   ├── api                     # Backend API (Fastify)
│   └── docs                    # Documentation site
│
├── examples/                    # Starter templates
│   ├── saas-minimal            # MVP only (@kaven/core + @kaven/ui)
│   └── saas-complete           # All modules
│
└── infrastructure/              # Shared configs
    ├── docker/
    ├── github-actions/
    └── grafana/
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Clean updates:** `npm update @kaven/core` pulls latest auth fixes
- ✅ **Cherry-pick modules:** Only install packages you need
- ✅ **Independent versioning:** CRM v2.0 doesn't force Core v3.0 upgrade
- ✅ **Testable in isolation:** Each package has own tests
- ✅ **Future monetization:** Sell premium packages separately

## 🔄 VERSIONING & UPDATE STRATEGY

### The Boilerplate Dilemma

**Classic Problem:**

1. Clone boilerplate → Customize heavily
2. Boilerplate releases security patch
3. How to apply update without losing customizations?

**Kaven's Solution: 3-Tier Strategy**

---

### **Tier 1: Git Upstream (Simple, MVP)**

For developers who want full control:

```bash
# Setup
git clone https://github.com/kaven/boilerplate my-saas
cd my-saas
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kaven/boilerplate

# Update months later
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main --allow-unrelated-histories
# Resolve conflicts manually
```

**✅ Pros:** Full ownership, no abstraction  
**❌ Cons:** Merge conflicts, manual work  
**Use when:** MVP stage, learning Kaven, small customizations

---

### **Tier 2: NPM Packages (Recommended, POST-MVP)**

Core features as versioned packages:

```bash
# Create new SaaS
npx create-kaven-app my-saas
cd my-saas

# Install modules
npm install @kaven/core @kaven/payments @kaven/crm

# Update later (semantic versioning)
npm update @kaven/core   # Gets bug fixes (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
npm install @kaven/core@2.0.0  # Explicit major upgrade
```

**✅ Pros:** Clean updates, modular, testable  
**❌ Cons:** More setup, requires npm registry  
**Use when:** Production SaaS, team collaboration, multiple projects

---

### **Tier 3: Hybrid (Best of Both)**

Structure via Git + Features via Packages:

```bash
# Clone base structure (Docker, CI/CD, configs)
git clone https://github.com/kaven/boilerplate my-saas

# Install feature packages
npm install @kaven/core @kaven/payments

# Update structure (manual merge)
git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main

# Update features (automatic)
npm update
```

**✅ Pros:** Flexibility + convenience  
**❌ Cons:** Two update mechanisms  
**Use when:** Need structure customization + feature stability

---

### **Recommended Migration Path**

1. **MVP (Months 1-2):** Use Tier 1 (Git clone)
2. **v1.0 (Month 3):** Migrate to Tier 2 (extract packages)
3. **Production:** Tier 3 (structure fork + packages)
