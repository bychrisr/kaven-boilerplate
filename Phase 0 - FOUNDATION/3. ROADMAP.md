### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Scope Creep:**

- ✅ Document everything upfront
- ✅ Mark features as MVP / POST-MVP / FUTURE
- ✅ No new features during MVP (defer to backlog)

**Documentation:**

- ✅ Allocate 2 full weeks (no coding)
- ✅ Review with stakeholder (you)
- ✅ Use templates (consistency)

**Multi-Tenant Complexity:**

- ✅ Extensive testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- ✅ Security audit (manual review)
- ✅ Penetration testing (if budget)

**Performance:**

- ✅ Load testing with k6
- ✅ Database indexes (critical)
- ✅ Redis caching (sessions, rate limiting)

**Security:**

- ✅ OWASP Top 10 checklist
- ✅ Dependency scanning (Snyk, npm audit)
- ✅ Code review (all PRs)

**Burnout:**

- ✅ Realistic deadlines (6 weeks MVP, not 2)
- ✅ Breaks between phases
- ✅ Celebrate milestones

**Adoption:**

- ✅ Quality first (better than competitors)
- ✅ Documentation (make it easy)
- ✅ Marketing (Dev.to, Twitter, Product Hunt)
